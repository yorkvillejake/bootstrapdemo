How do I update files in GitHub?

Case 1: Don't care about local changes
Solution 1: Get the latest code and reset the code git fetch origin git reset --hard origin/[tag/branch/commit-id usually: master]
Solution 2: Delete the folder and clone again :D. rm -rf [project_folder] git clone [remote_repo]

# after you're done editing...

$ git add.
$ git commit -m "msg"
$ git push


$ git status - shows where you're at "LOCALLY"

$ git branch [some name]  --> create a new branch to be merged later (e.g. belt, testing, student, schedule, etc. )
